prevent conda from filling up your home directory, you can create a new
directory at `/work/pi_<your_pi_name>/$USER/.conda/pkgs` and reload the module.

The argument `trust_remote_code` is to be used with Auto classes. It has no effect here and is ignored.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
