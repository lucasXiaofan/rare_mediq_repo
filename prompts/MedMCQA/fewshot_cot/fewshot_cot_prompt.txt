### Instruction:
A 56-year-old man has been having bloody bowel movements on and off for the past several weeks. He reports that the blood is bright red, it coats the outside of the stools, and he can see it in the toilet bowl even before he wipes himself. When he does so, there is also blood on the toilet paper. After further questioning, it is ascertained that he has been constipated for the past 2 months and that the caliber of the stools has changed. They are now pencil thin, rather than the usual diameter of an inch or so that was customary for him. He has no pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The 56-year-old man is experiencing intermittent bright red blood coating the outside of his stools, visible in the toilet bowl before wiping, along with blood on the toilet paper. He also reports constipation and a change in stool caliber to pencil-thin stools over the past two months, without any pain. Bright red blood coating the stool suggests bleeding from a distal part of the colon or rectum. The change to pencil-thin stools indicates a narrowing of the rectal lumen, likely due to an obstructing mass such as rectal cancer. Anal fissures typically cause severe pain during defecation and produce streaks of blood, but pain is absent in this case. Cancer of the cecum usually presents with occult blood loss leading to anemia, not visible bright red bleeding or changes in stool caliber. External hemorrhoids can cause discomfort and itching, and while they may bleed, they do not cause changes in stool caliber. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cancer of the rectum. The answer is C: Cancer of the rectum.

An 86-year-old man has become progressively unable to live independently for the past 10 years, and he now requires assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, and transfers in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination, he has no motor or sensory deficits. He cannot give the current date or state where he is. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. At autopsy, there is a large superficial left parietal lobe hemorrhage. Histologic examination of the brain shows numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The 86-year-old man has experienced a progressive decline in cognitive function over 10 years, requiring assistance with daily activities, which is indicative of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The autopsy findings reveal numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with Congo red staining of the cerebral arteries and plaque cores, indicating amyloid deposition. The mechanism behind Alzheimer's disease involves the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This leads to amyloid plaque formation and can cause cerebral amyloid angiopathy, contributing to hemorrhagic strokes like the one observed in the left parietal lobe. Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for his disease is aggregation of Aβ peptide. The answer is A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide.

An elderly house wife lost her husband who died suddenly of Myocardial infarction couple of years ago. They had been staying alone for almost a decade with infrequent visits from her son and grandchildren. About a week after the death she heard his voice clearly talking to her as he would in a routine manner from the next room. She went to check but saw nothing. Subsequently she often heard his voice conversing with her and she would also discuss her daily matters with him. This however, provoked anxiety and sadness of mood when she was preoccupied with his thought. She should be treated with: A: Clornipramine, B: Aiprazolam, C: Electroconvulsive therapy, D: Haloperidol

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The elderly woman lost her husband suddenly due to a myocardial infarction a couple of years ago. They had been living alone with infrequent visits from family. About a week after his death, she began hearing his voice talking to her as he would routinely, but when she checked, no one was there. She continues to hear his voice and even converses with him about daily matters. This provokes anxiety and sadness when she is preoccupied with his thoughts. These symptoms indicate she is experiencing auditory hallucinations of her deceased husband, which is a sign of morbid (complicated) grief. Morbid grief occurs when the normal grieving process is exaggerated or prolonged beyond six months, and may include psychotic features like hallucinations. Treatment for morbid grief depends on the presenting symptoms. Since she is primarily experiencing distressing auditory hallucinations, an antipsychotic medication is appropriate. Among the options, haloperidol is an antipsychotic that can help alleviate her symptoms. The answer is D: Haloperidol.
