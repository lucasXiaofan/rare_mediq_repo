### Instruction:
A 56-year-old man has been having bloody bowel movements on and off for the past several weeks. He reports that the blood is bright red, it coats the outside of the stools, and he can see it in the toilet bowl even before he wipes himself. When he does so, there is also blood on the toilet paper. After further questioning, it is ascertained that he has been constipated for the past 2 months and that the caliber of the stools has changed. They are now pencil thin, rather than the usual diameter of an inch or so that was customary for him. He has no pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids

### Relevant Documents:
Cancer of the rectum often presents in older adults with painless rectal bleeding and changes in bowel habits. Symptoms may include bright red blood coating the stool, visible bleeding in the toilet bowl, and alterations in stool caliber such as pencil-thin stools due to obstruction caused by the tumor narrowing the rectal lumen.
Anal fissures are small tears in the anoderm that typically cause severe pain during defecation and produce bright red blood streaks on the stool or toilet paper. Pain is a prominent symptom, and they are more common in younger individuals.
Cancer of the cecum usually presents with occult blood loss leading to iron-deficiency anemia rather than visible bright red bleeding. Changes in stool caliber are uncommon since the cecum has a larger diameter, and tumors there rarely cause obstruction until advanced stages.

### Response:
The patient is a 56-year-old man experiencing intermittent bright red blood coating his stools, visible bleeding before wiping, constipation, and a change to pencil-thin stools over the past two months, all without pain. These symptoms are characteristic of cancer of the rectum, where a tumor causes luminal narrowing leading to changes in stool caliber and painless rectal bleeding. Anal fissures would present with significant pain during defecation, which is absent here. Cancer of the cecum typically causes occult bleeding and anemia, not bright red blood or stool caliber changes. External hemorrhoids may cause bleeding but rarely lead to changes in stool shape or significant bleeding. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cancer of the rectum. The answer is C: Cancer of the rectum.

An 86-year-old man has become progressively unable to live independently for the past 10 years, and he now requires assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, and transfers in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination, he has no motor or sensory deficits. He cannot give the current date or state where he is. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. At autopsy, there is a large superficial left parietal lobe hemorrhage. Histologic examination of the brain shows numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, eventually leading to a loss of independence in activities of daily living. Histologically, it is marked by the presence of numerous neuritic (senile) plaques composed of aggregated beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The Aβ peptide is formed through abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase enzymes, leading to its aggregation and deposition in the brain parenchyma.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, often associated with Alzheimer's disease, involves the deposition of Aβ peptide in the walls of cerebral blood vessels. This deposition weakens the vessel walls and increases the risk of spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhages, particularly in elderly individuals. Congo red staining is used histologically to identify amyloid deposits, which appear as apple-green birefringence under polarized light.
Other neurodegenerative diseases have distinct mechanisms. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by conformational changes in the prion protein (PrP), leading to rapidly progressive dementia and spongiform encephalopathy without amyloid plaque formation. Parkinson's disease is associated with dopamine deficiency due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, presenting primarily with motor symptoms. Huntington disease results from the expansion of polyglutamine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene, causing neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia and leading to chorea and psychiatric disturbances.

### Response:
The elderly man's progressive cognitive decline over 10 years, requiring assistance with daily activities, is indicative of Alzheimer's disease. The autopsy findings of numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that stain positively with Congo red confirm this diagnosis, as Congo red staining highlights amyloid deposition from aggregated beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Additionally, the large superficial parietal lobe hemorrhage suggests cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where Aβ deposition in cerebral vessels leads to weakened walls and hemorrhage. Therefore, the mechanism most likely responsible for his disease is the aggregation of Aβ peptide resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein. The answer is A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide.

An elderly house wife lost her husband who died suddenly of Myocardial infarction couple of years ago. They had been staying alone for almost a decade with infrequent visits from her son and grandchildren. About a week after the death she heard his voice clearly talking to her as he would in a routine manner from the next room. She went to check but saw nothing. Subsequently she often heard his voice conversing with her and she would also discuss her daily matters with him. This however, provoked anxiety and sadness of mood when she was preoccupied with his thought. She should be treated with: A: Clornipramine, B: Aiprazolam, C: Electroconvulsive therapy, D: Haloperidol

Morbid or complicated grief is a condition where the normal grieving process becomes prolonged and intensified, often lasting beyond six months. Individuals may experience persistent yearning for the deceased, difficulty accepting the loss, and significant impairment in daily functioning. Psychotic features, such as hallucinations of the deceased person, can occur, leading to additional distress.
Treatment for morbid grief focuses on alleviating symptoms and helping the individual cope with the loss. Psychotherapy, including grief counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy, is the cornerstone of treatment. When psychotic symptoms like auditory hallucinations are present, pharmacotherapy is indicated. Antipsychotic medications are effective in reducing hallucinations and associated anxiety.
Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic medication used to treat psychotic disorders and symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, helping to reduce abnormal neuronal activity. Other medications like clomipramine are antidepressants used for conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, while alprazolam is an anxiolytic used for anxiety disorders. Electroconvulsive therapy is generally reserved for severe depression or treatment-resistant cases.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The elderly woman is experiencing auditory hallucinations of her deceased husband, engaging in conversations with him, which leads to anxiety and sadness. This suggests she is suffering from morbid (complicated) grief with psychotic features. The presence of hallucinations indicates that pharmacological treatment is necessary to manage her symptoms. Among the options provided: Clomipramine is an antidepressant primarily used for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is not effective for hallucinations. Alprazolam is an anxiolytic that treats anxiety but does not address psychotic symptoms like hallucinations. Electroconvulsive therapy is generally used for severe depression or refractory psychiatric conditions and is not first-line for this scenario. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication effective in treating hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for her is Haloperidol to address the auditory hallucinations associated with her morbid grief. The answer is D: Haloperidol.
