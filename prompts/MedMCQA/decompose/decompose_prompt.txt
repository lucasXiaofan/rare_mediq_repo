Question 1: A 60-year-old chronic smoker presents with painless gross hematuria of 1-day duration. Investigation of choice to know the cause of hematuria. A: USG, B: X-ray KUB, C: Urine routine, D: Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells
Question 1.1: What is the most likely cause of painless gross hematuria in a 60-year-old chronic smoker?
Answer 1.1: In a 60-year-old chronic smoker, painless gross hematuria is highly suggestive of bladder cancer, specifically transitional cell carcinoma, as smoking is a major risk factor. The answer is bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma).
Question 1.2: What is the most appropriate initial investigation to detect bladder cancer in this patient?
Answer 1.2: The most appropriate initial investigation is urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells, which can detect cancer cells shed into the urine and is non-invasive. The answer is urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells.
Question 1.3: Now we can answer the question: Investigation of choice to know the cause of hematuria in this patient.
Answer 1.3: Given the high suspicion of bladder cancer in a chronic smoker with painless hematuria, the investigation of choice is urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells. Therefore, the best answer is D: Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells.

Question 2: A 56-year-old man has been having bloody bowel movements on and off for the past several weeks. He reports that the blood is bright red, it coats the outside of the stools, and he can see it in the toilet bowl even before he wipes himself. When he does so, there is also blood on the toilet paper. After further questioning, it is ascertained that he has been constipated for the past 2 months and that the caliber of the stools has changed. They are now pencil thin, rather than the usual diameter of an inch or so that was customary for him. He has no pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids
Question 2.1: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Answer 2.1: The patient is a 56-year-old man experiencing intermittent bright red blood coating the outside of his stools, visible blood in the toilet bowl, blood on toilet paper, constipation for 2 months, a change in stool caliber to pencil-thin stools, and no pain. The answer is that the patient has painless bright red rectal bleeding, change in stool caliber, and constipation.
Question 2.2: What is the significance of bright red blood coating the outside of stools and pencil-thin stools?
Answer 2.2: Bright red blood coating the outside of stools indicates bleeding from a distal source in the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the rectum or anal canal. Pencil-thin stools suggest a narrowing of the rectal lumen, possibly due to an obstructing mass. The answer is that these symptoms point toward a distal colorectal lesion causing obstruction and bleeding.
Question 2.3: Which conditions among the options are associated with these clinical features?
Answer 2.3: Cancer of the rectum is associated with painless rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits, and narrowing of stool caliber. Anal fissures typically cause severe pain during defecation and blood streaks on the stool but are uncommon in this age group without pain. Cancer of the cecum usually presents with occult blood loss and anemia, not bright red bleeding or stool caliber changes. External hemorrhoids can cause bleeding and discomfort but rarely lead to changes in stool caliber. The answer is that cancer of the rectum is the condition most consistent with these features.
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Answer 2.4: Based on the patient's age, painless bright red rectal bleeding, change in stool caliber, and constipation, the most likely diagnosis is cancer of the rectum. Therefore, the correct choice is C: Cancer of the rectum.

Question 3: An 86-year-old man has become progressively unable to live independently for the past 10 years, and he now requires assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, and transfers in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination, he has no motor or sensory deficits. He cannot give the current date or state where he is. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. At autopsy, there is a large superficial left parietal lobe hemorrhage. Histologic examination of the brain shows numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats
Question 3.1: What is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's clinical presentation and histological findings?
Answer 3.1: The patient is an elderly man with a 10-year history of progressive decline in cognitive and daily functioning abilities, consistent with dementia. Histological findings of numerous neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that stain with Congo red are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The answer is Alzheimer's disease.
Question 3.2: What is the significance of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles staining positively with Congo red?
Answer 3.2: Congo red staining indicates the presence of amyloid deposits in tissues. In Alzheimer's disease, neuritic plaques composed of aggregated beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein stain positively with Congo red. The answer is that Congo red positivity signifies amyloid deposition, specifically aggregated Aβ peptide.
Question 3.3: What is the mechanism leading to amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease?
Answer 3.3: In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase enzymes leads to the formation and aggregation of Aβ peptide, which deposits in the brain forming amyloid plaques. The answer is aggregation of Aβ peptide due to abnormal APP processing.
Question 3.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease?
Answer 3.4: The mechanism most likely responsible for the patient's Alzheimer's disease is the aggregation of Aβ peptide (option A). Therefore, the correct answer is A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide.
