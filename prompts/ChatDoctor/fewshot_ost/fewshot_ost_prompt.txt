Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify key symptoms from the patient's description. The main symptoms include facial tightness that occurs on both sides of the face, chest and shoulder burning sensation, and improvement of symptoms with lying down, eating, exercising, and drinking alcohol. The patient also reports normal heart tests and negative neurological evaluations.
Step 2: Analyze the time course and factors that influence symptom relief. The fact that lying down, eating, exercising, and drinking alcohol temporarily relieve both the facial tightness and chest burning sensation suggests that the issue may be functional or related to lifestyle factors rather than structural damage.
Step 3: Review the history of anxiety diagnosis. Several doctors, including specialists, have suggested that the symptoms are anxiety-related. Given the absence of physical abnormalities on exams and the improvement of symptoms with lifestyle changes, it seems likely that anxiety could be contributing to the physical sensations.
Step 4: Consider alternative explanations for the symptoms. While anxiety is a strong possibility, the patient’s concern about potential neurological damage should not be dismissed entirely. However, the thorough neurological workups and normal tests make conditions like facial dystonia or nerve damage unlikely.
Step 5: Address the new concerns about the persistence of symptoms. It’s important to acknowledge that even if anxiety is the root cause, the continued experience of symptoms can be distressing. The patient may benefit from further exploration of stress-relief methods, therapy, or a second opinion to ease their concerns.
Step 6: Provide guidance on next steps. Recommend continued follow-up with a healthcare provider to manage symptoms and explore possible treatments, such as anxiety management techniques or lifestyle adjustments. Additional tests, like vitamin D or cervical spine evaluation, could help rule out any overlooked issues.
Step 7: Reassure the patient. Based on the tests already performed, the heart and neurological systems appear healthy. It's crucial to reassure the patient that their symptoms, while bothersome, are not life-threatening.
Step 8: Conclusion. The most likely cause of these symptoms remains anxiety, as indicated by the multiple evaluations. The patient should continue managing stress and follow up with their healthcare provider if symptoms persist.

Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today? Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk? Should we be worried? Thank you.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the key concerns from the user. The user is worried about the possibility of pregnancy after his girlfriend missed a contraceptive pill, especially since they had unprotected sex the night before. Specific questions revolve around whether the morning-after pill should be used, how effective it would be, and the overall risk of pregnancy.
Step 2: Analyze the situation regarding the contraceptive pill. The girlfriend started taking the combined contraceptive pill regularly and has been on it for around two weeks. Since she missed the pill only for a few hours (from 8 AM to 2:16 PM), it is important to understand that missing a single pill by a few hours does not significantly reduce its effectiveness if she had been taking it consistently before.
Step 3: Consider the effectiveness of the combined contraceptive pill. If she has been taking the pill regularly for at least 7 consecutive days, it should offer protection even if she misses one dose by a few hours. Therefore, the risk of pregnancy in this case is low.
Step 4: Address the question about the morning-after pill. Since the girlfriend has been on the regular combined contraceptive pill for about two weeks and only missed one pill by a few hours, the morning-after pill may not be necessary. The regular pill, when taken consistently, provides about 99% protection against pregnancy, so taking the missed pill as soon as possible would be the best course of action.
Step 5: Discuss ovulation and its relevance. The user believes that his girlfriend may be in her ovulation phase, but it is important to note that the combined contraceptive pill suppresses ovulation, meaning she likely hasn't ovulated. This further reduces the risk of pregnancy.
Step 6: Provide recommendations for the missed pill. The girlfriend should take the missed pill as soon as possible (around 4 PM) and continue with her regular schedule of taking the pills at 8 AM each day. There is no need to take the morning-after pill if the missed dose is made up within the same day.
Step 7: Address the overall risk of pregnancy. Given that she has been consistently taking the pill and missed only one dose by a few hours, the risk of pregnancy is very low. There is no need to panic, but it's important to maintain regular pill intake moving forward.
Step 8: Conclusion. The best course of action is to take the missed pill today as soon as possible and continue with the regular pill schedule. The risk of pregnancy is minimal, and the morning-after pill is not necessary in this case.

Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the key issues from the user. The patient is a 33-year-old woman with left leg pain that has persisted for six months. She has undergone multiple tests, including venous and arterial Doppler ultrasounds, and an MRI. There is a concern about peripheral artery disease (PAD) or a potential blood clot, as well as questions about the safety of flying with these symptoms.
Step 2: Review the diagnostic tests performed. The venous Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer tests were both negative, which helps rule out venous thrombosis (blood clot in the veins). The arterial Doppler showed decreased blood flow in the left anterior tibial artery, but no stenosis, sclerosis, or plaque was found, suggesting there is no significant arterial blockage.
Step 3: Analyze the patient's current symptoms. The patient reports coldness in her left foot and lower leg at night, which normalizes by morning. This may be due to temporary changes in blood flow or nerve irritation. The patient also describes sciatic-like pain, which could be related to nerve compression or musculoskeletal issues rather than vascular disease.
Step 4: Consider the likelihood of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absence of stenosis, sclerosis, or plaque on the arterial Doppler makes PAD unlikely, especially in a young, non-smoking woman with no other major risk factors like diabetes or obesity. Additionally, PAD typically presents with claudication (pain with exertion) rather than symptoms that fluctuate as described.
Step 5: Address the possibility of a blood clot. The D-dimer test is specific for detecting blood clots in the venous system and was negative. Since the Doppler did not show any arterial blockages, the likelihood of a blood clot in the artery is low.
Step 6: Evaluate the safety of flying. Given the normal Doppler results and absence of a blood clot, it is safe for the patient to fly. However, it is still recommended to take precautions during long flights, such as stretching, walking, and staying hydrated to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Step 7: Discuss potential next steps. The sciatic-like pain could be related to nerve compression in the lower back or musculoskeletal issues in the leg. Further investigation, such as an evaluation by an orthopedic specialist or neurologist, may be beneficial. The cold sensation in the leg could be due to nerve irritation or poor circulation from non-vascular causes.
Step 8: Conclusion. The patient is unlikely to have peripheral artery disease or a blood clot, and flying should be safe. Further evaluation for musculoskeletal or nerve-related causes of the pain is recommended.
