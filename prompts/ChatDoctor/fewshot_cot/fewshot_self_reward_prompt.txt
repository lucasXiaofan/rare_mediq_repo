Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.

### Response:
Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you are experiencing a form of facial dystonia, such as blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. These conditions can cause involuntary muscle contractions and tightness in the face, sometimes spreading to the neck and other areas. Additionally, your symptoms of heartburn and chest discomfort may be related to acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can also cause throat and chest tightness.\n\nIt would be helpful to see a neurologist or movement disorder specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and possible testing, such as electromyography (EMG), to determine if there is any nerve or muscle dysfunction present. In the meantime, it may be worth trying some relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to help manage any anxiety or stress that may be exacerbating your symptoms. Avoiding trigger foods and eating smaller, more frequent meals may also help relieve your heartburn symptoms.

### Analysis:
The response offers plausible suggestions but has notable flaws. First, the diagnosis of facial dystonia is speculative, especially since the patient has already seen a neuro-specialist, which weakens the reasoning. GERD is mentioned as a cause of heartburn and chest discomfort, which is valid, but the response fails to emphasize the benign cardiac findings that could reassure the patient. While relaxation techniques for anxiety are recommended, the patient explicitly mentioned doubting anxiety as the cause, and the response doesn't address this adequately. The failure to fully engage with the patient's history and concerns limits the clarity and depth of the reasoning. The score is 55.

Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.

### Response:
Hello! I understand your concerns. Please note that there is no need to worry, but taking action to minimize the risk of pregnancy is important. Here are my answers to your questions:\n\n1. Should she take the morning after pill?\n- Yes, I would strongly recommend taking the morning after pill as soon as possible.\n\n2. How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?\n- The morning after pill can be highly effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. However, the sooner it is taken, the more effective it will be.\n\n3. How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?\n- Consistently taking the combined contraceptive pill as prescribed can significantly reduce the risk of pregnancy, but missing even one pill can decrease its effectiveness.\n\n4. Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?\n- Ovulation may occur at different times for different women, but unprotected sex during ovulation can increase the risk of pregnancy. However, it is difficult to estimate the exact risk in this situation. Taking the morning after pill as soon as possible can help reduce the risk of pregnancy.\n\n5. Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?\n- Yes, she should take today's pill as soon as she remembers, even if she takes the morning after pill.\n\n6. Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?\n- The best way to minimize the risk is to take the morning after pill as soon as possible and to consistently use contraception in the future.\n\n7. Should we be worried?\n- There is no need to panic, but taking action to minimize the risk of pregnancy is important. Talk to a healthcare professional if you have further concerns or questions.

### Analysis:
The response provides general advice, but there are some issues in accuracy and clarity. First, while recommending the morning-after pill is reasonable, the response lacks specificity regarding the patient starting a regular combined contraceptive pill, which typically provides protection after seven consecutive days of use. The effectiveness of the regular pill should have been emphasized more clearly, especially since the girlfriend has been taking it consistently for several days. The response also doesn't clarify that missing one pill by a few hours is usually not a significant concern, especially in this case where it was less than 24 hours. Furthermore, the risk of pregnancy during ovulation should have been framed more cautiously, as regular contraceptive pills can still provide protection even if ovulation occurs. The recommendation to take both the missed pill and the morning-after pill is appropriate, but could be presented with more detailed reasoning about how they work together. Overall, while the advice is mostly correct, it could have been clearer and more tailored to the situation. The score is 65.

Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.

### Response:
As you describe, all your reports are within normal range except LDL. The problem with LDL is that most people do not know their level until they take a test. Even if your LDL level is slightly higher than what is considered normal, it does not mean that you will get heart attack or stroke. You should discuss with your cardiologist about the need for medications to reduce your cholesterol levels. Regarding your symptoms, I would suggest taking medication such as pregabalin or gabapentin which can give relief from pain. If these medicines fail to relieve your symptoms, you may require further investigations including angiography. Hope this helps. Take care.

### Analysis:
The response provides some general advice but lacks sufficient detail and accuracy. First, the focus on LDL cholesterol is somewhat misplaced, as the patient's primary concern is her leg pain and vascular symptoms, not her cholesterol levels. While addressing the LDL is important, it should not overshadow the main issue. The recommendation of pregabalin or gabapentin for pain relief is reasonable for neuropathic pain, but the response doesn't fully explain why these medications are appropriate for this patient’s symptoms or explore other possible causes, such as musculoskeletal or vascular issues. Furthermore, the response doesn't adequately address the patient's concern about flying with potential vascular issues or explain the relevance of the D-dimer test, which is for venous clots, versus an arterial issue. The recommendation for angiography is mentioned vaguely without explaining when or why it would be necessary, leaving the advice somewhat unclear and incomplete. The score is 50.
