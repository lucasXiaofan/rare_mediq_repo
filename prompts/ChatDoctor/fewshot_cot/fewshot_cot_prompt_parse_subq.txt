Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.

Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the possible explanations for your symptoms given your history and previous medical evaluations?
Subanswer: Your symptoms of facial tightness, burning sensations in the chest and shoulders, and relief from these symptoms through lying down, eating, exercising, and drinking alcohol could be indicative of anxiety, as your doctors have suggested. These activities are known to temporarily alleviate anxiety-related symptoms.
Subquestion: Are there other conditions that might cause these symptoms, and what further evaluations could be considered?
Subanswer: Other potential causes might include vitamin deficiencies (such as vitamin D), blood pressure irregularities, or musculoskeletal issues like problems in the cervical spine that could lead to similar sensations. It might be helpful to explore these possibilities with your healthcare provider.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.
Subanswer: Hello. I have carefully read your concerns and understand that you're feeling anxious about the persistent facial tightness and new sensations you're experiencing. While your doctors have suggested that anxiety may be the cause—which is supported by the fact that your symptoms improve with lying down, eating, exercising, and drinking alcohol—it is important to ensure that other potential causes are considered. I recommend discussing with your healthcare provider the possibility of checking your vitamin levels, such as vitamin D, and monitoring your blood pressure to rule out any deficiencies or imbalances. Additionally, a cervical spine evaluation might be beneficial to exclude any issues like a bulging disc that could contribute to your symptoms. In the meantime, incorporating stress-reduction techniques and perhaps discussing the use of supplements like magnesium with your doctor might help alleviate muscle tension. Please remember that it's important to continue communicating with your healthcare professionals about your ongoing symptoms so they can provide personalized advice and support.

Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk? Should we be worried? Thank you.

Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What is the significance of missing a combined oral contraceptive pill by a few hours?
Subanswer: Missing a combined oral contraceptive pill by a few hours generally does not significantly reduce its effectiveness, especially if the pill is taken as soon as it is remembered within 24 hours.
Subquestion: Should she take the morning-after pill if she missed her regular contraceptive pill this morning?
Subanswer: In most cases, taking an emergency contraceptive (morning-after pill) is not necessary if only one combined oral contraceptive pill is missed and is taken promptly. However, since she started the pill after her period and has been on it for less than seven days, consulting a healthcare professional is advisable to determine if emergency contraception is needed.
Subquestion: How effective are the pills previously taken in lowering the risk of pregnancy?
Subanswer: Combined oral contraceptive pills typically become fully effective after seven consecutive days of use. Since she started taking the pills recently, the effectiveness may not be at its maximum, and additional contraceptive methods are usually recommended during the first week.
Subquestion: Given her current stage in the menstrual cycle, what is the risk of pregnancy?
Subanswer: If unprotected intercourse occurred during the ovulation phase and the contraceptive pills have not been taken for at least seven days, there may be an increased risk of pregnancy. Ovulation typically occurs around 10 to 14 days after the start of the menstrual period.
Subquestion:  Should she continue taking today's missed pill if she decides to take the morning-after pill?
Subanswer: Generally, she should continue taking her regular contraceptive pills as scheduled, even if she takes emergency contraception. It's important to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice in this situation.
Subquestion: Is there anything else you can do now to minimize the risk?
Subanswer: Consulting a healthcare professional promptly can provide guidance on whether emergency contraception is appropriate and how to proceed with her regular contraceptive pills.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Should we be worried?
Subanswer: Hello. I understand your concerns regarding the missed contraceptive pill and the risk of pregnancy. Since your girlfriend started taking the combined oral contraceptive pills recently and missed a dose after unprotected intercourse, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They can clarify whether emergency contraception is necessary and guide you on how to continue with the regular pills. Remember, taking a pill a few hours late is generally acceptable, but since she is within the first week of starting the pills, additional precautions may be needed. It's important not to worry excessively but to seek medical guidance to address your questions and ensure peace of mind.

Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the patient's symptoms and medical history?
Subanswer: You are a 33-year-old female, non-smoker, not overweight, and without diabetes. Six months ago, you started experiencing pain in your left calf, ankle, and groin, which led to limping. An MRI showed a talofibular ligament sprain in your left ankle. An emergency venous Doppler ultrasound and a D-dimer test were negative. An arterial Doppler ultrasound revealed decreased flow in the left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery, but no stenosis, sclerosis, or plaque.
Subquestion: What recent events have affected your symptoms?
Subanswer: After a pedicure where your ankle and leg were massaged, the pain in your left ankle and leg returned. You have also started experiencing a cold sensation in your left foot and lower leg at night, which normalizes by morning. Additionally, you feel pain in your buttocks that radiates down your left leg, resembling sciatic pain.
Subquestion: What are your main concerns and questions?
Subanswer: You are worried about the possibility of peripheral artery disease or a blood clot causing your symptoms. You're concerned about the safety of flying on an upcoming four-hour flight. You want to know if the arterial Doppler and D-dimer tests can detect a blood clot in your artery or if the D-dimer is only for veins. You also mention that your LDL cholesterol was slightly elevated, but your doctor was not concerned due to your high HDL levels.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question:
Subanswer: From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved. I suspect the same problem or something similar is causing you the pain again. It is highly unlikely for a 33 year old lady and a non-smoker to have a peripheral vascular disease. The arterial Doppler did show a decreased blood flow, but it might be due to a temporary spasm of the vessel than any specific pathology or disease. Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease. I suggest you to look for causes either in your footwear or any strain which you have put repeatedly on your ankle causing repeated sprain in the left ankle. You can get an orthopedic consultation to be sure of the same. If he or she does not find any problem and your pain persists even after appropriate treatment then further evaluation can be done by a vascular surgeon. But, I do feel you may not require it.
