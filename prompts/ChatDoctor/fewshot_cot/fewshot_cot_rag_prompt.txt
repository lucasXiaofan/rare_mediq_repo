Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.

Anxiety and Physical Symptoms Relief: Anxiety can manifest through physical symptoms such as muscle tension, facial tightness, and chest discomfort. These symptoms often improve with activities like lying down, exercising, or consuming alcohol, as these activities help relax the body. Addressing anxiety through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation techniques, and physical activity can significantly alleviate such symptoms.
Vitamin D Deficiency and Musculoskeletal Symptoms: Low levels of vitamin D can lead to muscle weakness, pain, and tension, especially in the neck, shoulders, and face. Testing for vitamin D levels can help identify a deficiency, which can be treated with supplements, leading to improved muscle function and reduced discomfort. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in musculoskeletal health and overall well-being.
Cervical Spine and Nerve Compression: A bulging disc in the cervical spine can cause nerve compression, leading to symptoms such as burning sensations, pain in the neck, and radiating discomfort to the shoulders and arms. A cervical spine X-ray or MRI can help identify disc issues or nerve impingement. Physical therapy or appropriate medical interventions may alleviate symptoms if nerve-related issues are confirmed.

### Response:
Hello. I read carefully your question and would agree with your Doctor on the fact that all your symptoms are suggestive of anxiety. The fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down, alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety. Anyways, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend checking vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances. It is also necessary performing a cervical spine X-ray study, in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements, to help relieve the muscle spasm.

Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today? Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk? Should we be worried? Thank you.

Effectiveness of the Combined Contraceptive Pill and Missed Dose Guidance: The combined oral contraceptive pill is highly effective (around 99%) when taken consistently and correctly. Missing a pill by a few hours generally does not significantly reduce its effectiveness, but if a pill is missed for more than 24 hours, additional precautions should be taken. If the pill was started within the past seven days, and unprotected sex occurred, there may be a slightly increased risk of pregnancy, and additional contraception (like the morning-after pill) may be considered.
Morning-After Pill and Timing of Effectiveness: The morning-after pill is most effective when taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex, but it can still provide significant protection up to 72 hours afterward. It works by delaying ovulation and does not interfere with ongoing contraceptive use. If a dose of the regular contraceptive pill is missed and unprotected sex occurs, taking the morning-after pill can provide extra protection, especially if the pill schedule was not fully established in the first week.
Risk of Pregnancy During the First Week of Contraceptive Use: When starting the combined oral contraceptive pill for the first time, it takes about seven days for the contraceptive effect to become fully established. During this first week, additional contraception (such as condoms) is recommended. If unprotected sex occurs during this time and a pill is missed, there is an increased risk of ovulation and pregnancy, so emergency contraception may be advised. Continuing the regular pill as soon as possible is important to maintain contraceptive effectiveness moving forward.

### Response:
Hello. I understand your concerns regarding the missed contraceptive pill and the risk of pregnancy. Since your girlfriend started taking the combined oral contraceptive pills recently and missed a dose after unprotected intercourse, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They can clarify whether emergency contraception is necessary and guide you on how to continue with the regular pills. Remember, taking a pill a few hours late is generally acceptable, but since she is within the first week of starting the pills, additional precautions may be needed. It's important not to worry excessively but to seek medical guidance to address your questions and ensure peace of mind.

Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.

Talofibular Ligament Sprain and Recurrent Pain: A talofibular ligament sprain, especially when not fully healed or aggravated by physical activities (like a pedicure or massage), can cause recurring pain and discomfort in the ankle and leg. This type of injury does not typically cause long-term vascular issues but can lead to temporary muscle or ligament strain that mimics other conditions. Consulting an orthopedic specialist can help confirm whether the pain is due to a recurrent sprain or other musculoskeletal issues.
Peripheral Artery Disease in Young, Healthy Individuals: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is more common in older adults, smokers, and individuals with risk factors like diabetes or high cholesterol. It is rare in young, non-smoking, healthy individuals with normal LDL and HDL levels. Temporary decreases in blood flow, such as those detected on an arterial Doppler, may be caused by vessel spasms rather than chronic vascular disease. An arterial Doppler can effectively assess blood flow and detect clots, but in this case, no stenosis or plaque was found, making PAD unlikely.
D-dimer Test and Its Use in Diagnosing Blood Clots: The D-dimer test is designed to detect blood clots in the venous system (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) by measuring fibrin degradation products. It is not useful for diagnosing clots in the arterial system. For arterial clot detection, imaging techniques like an arterial Doppler ultrasound are more appropriate. Since the patient’s Doppler was clear and the D-dimer negative, the likelihood of a blood clot is very low.

### Response:
From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved. I suspect the same problem or something similar is causing you the pain again. It is highly unlikely for a 33 year old lady and a non-smoker to have a peripheral vascular disease. The arterial Doppler did show a decreased blood flow, but it might be due to a temporary spasm of the vessel than any specific pathology or disease. Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease. I suggest you to look for causes either in your footwear or any strain which you have put repeatedly on your ankle causing repeated sprain in the left ankle. You can get an orthopedic consultation to be sure of the same. If he or she does not find any problem and your pain persists even after appropriate treatment then further evaluation can be done by a vascular surgeon. But, I do feel you may not require it.
