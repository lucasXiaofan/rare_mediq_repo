Question 1: Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick. Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.
Query 1.1: The relationship between anxiety and physical symptoms like facial tightness and new sensations.
Document 1.1: Anxiety is well-known to cause various physical symptoms, including muscle tension, facial tightness, and even burning sensations. These symptoms often improve with relaxation, such as lying down or eating, and can mimic or worsen other underlying conditions. Stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and physical activity, are common interventions. In some cases, supplements like magnesium may help reduce muscle tension. Anxiety can exacerbate preexisting conditions, so it's important to rule out other causes while addressing the stress component.
Query 1.2: The role of vitamin deficiencies (e.g., vitamin D) in causing symptoms like facial tightness and muscle tension.
Document 1.2: Vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin D, can lead to musculoskeletal symptoms such as muscle pain, weakness, and facial tightness. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased muscle tension and discomfort. Ensuring adequate vitamin levels through blood tests can help identify deficiencies that may contribute to the patient's symptoms. If vitamin D deficiency is detected, supplementation can alleviate the muscle-related symptoms, although it may take weeks to see improvements.
Query 1.3: Potential impact of cervical spine issues (e.g., bulging disc) on facial tightness and radiating sensations.
Document 1.3: Cervical spine problems, such as a bulging disc or nerve compression, can cause referred pain or muscle tightness in the face, neck, and shoulders. These issues can result in radiating sensations, including tightness or burning, that may be mistaken for anxiety-related symptoms. A cervical spine evaluation, including imaging (such as MRI), may help rule out structural problems that could be contributing to the patient's discomfort. Physical therapy or interventions targeting the cervical spine can help alleviate these symptoms if a spinal issue is identified.
Query 1.4: The relationship between blood pressure fluctuations and symptoms like facial tightness and chest sensations.
Document 1.4: Blood pressure fluctuations can contribute to symptoms such as facial tightness, headaches, and feelings of pressure in the chest. Both low and high blood pressure can cause these sensations, especially if they occur alongside anxiety or other stress-related conditions. Monitoring blood pressure regularly can help detect any abnormalities or imbalances contributing to the patientâ€™s symptoms. Addressing blood pressure issues through lifestyle changes or medication may relieve these discomforts if hypertension or hypotension is a factor.
Query 1.5: Magnesium supplements and their effect on muscle tension and anxiety-related symptoms.
Document 1.5: Magnesium plays a key role in muscle relaxation and nervous system function. A deficiency in magnesium can lead to muscle tension, cramps, and increased stress or anxiety. Supplementing magnesium may help reduce muscle tension, particularly in patients experiencing tightness in the face or neck. Additionally, magnesium is sometimes recommended for its calming effect, which can be helpful in managing anxiety-related physical symptoms. Consulting with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage is important.

Question 2: Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk? Should we be worried? Thank you.
Query 2.1: Difference between the morning-after pill and regular oral contraceptive pills.
Document 2.1: The morning-after pill, also known as emergency contraception, is designed to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex and is used only on an as-needed basis. It is different from regular oral contraceptive pills, which are taken daily to prevent pregnancy by maintaining consistent hormone levels. Morning-after pills, like levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate, work primarily by delaying ovulation and should not be confused with regular birth control pills. Morning-after pills are effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, but they are not intended for regular use.
Query 2.2: Effectiveness of the regular combined contraceptive pill when taken consistently.
Document 2.2: When taken consistently and correctly, the combined oral contraceptive pill is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This high level of effectiveness is achieved by preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus to block sperm, and thinning the uterine lining. The pill must be taken daily at around the same time to maintain its efficacy. A delay of a few hours in taking the pill does not significantly reduce its effectiveness, provided that no pill is skipped. Missing a pill entirely or being more than 24 hours late in taking it can decrease its effectiveness.
Query 2.3: Protocol for missed doses of the combined contraceptive pill.
Document 2.3: If a combined contraceptive pill is missed but the delay is less than 24 hours, the pill should be taken as soon as remembered, and the next pill should be taken at the usual time. There is no need for additional contraception or emergency contraception (such as the morning-after pill) unless multiple pills have been missed or the delay exceeds 24 hours. In such cases, the effectiveness of the regular pill decreases, and additional contraception is recommended for the following 7 days.
Query 2.4: Timing of taking the morning-after pill and its effectiveness.
Document 2.4: The morning-after pill is most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex, with efficacy decreasing as time passes. It is still effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex but provides the highest level of protection within the first 24 hours. The morning-after pill works primarily by delaying ovulation, and if ovulation has already occurred, it may not prevent pregnancy. If a woman is already taking regular birth control pills consistently, the need for a morning-after pill is generally low unless multiple pills have been missed.
Query 2.5: Risk of pregnancy during the ovulation phase when using the combined contraceptive pill.
Document 2.5: Ovulation typically occurs around the middle of the menstrual cycle (around day 14 in a 28-day cycle). When a woman is taking the combined contraceptive pill correctly and consistently, ovulation is suppressed, reducing the risk of pregnancy significantly, even during the ovulation phase. If the pill has been taken consistently for at least 7 days before unprotected sex, the risk of pregnancy is very low (around 1%). If pills have been missed or taken inconsistently, there is a higher risk of ovulation occurring, which can increase the likelihood of pregnancy.
Query 2.6: Is it safe to continue taking the regular contraceptive pill after using the morning-after pill?
Document 2.6: If a woman needs to take the morning-after pill due to missed doses of regular contraception, she can continue taking her regular contraceptive pill the following day. There is no harm in taking both, but additional contraceptive measures (such as using condoms) are recommended for at least 7 days after the missed dose. However, if she has not missed any regular contraceptive pills, there is generally no need for the morning-after pill, and she should continue her regular contraceptive regimen as usual.

Question 3: Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.
Query 3.1: Can a talofibular ligament sprain cause decreased blood flow in the leg?
Document 3.1: A talofibular ligament sprain is a common injury of the ankle, typically causing pain, swelling, and instability in the joint. While it primarily affects the ligaments and soft tissues, it is not usually associated with significant decreases in blood flow to the leg. However, in some cases, swelling or local inflammation from the injury could temporarily compress nearby blood vessels, leading to reduced flow. This reduced flow is usually transient and resolves as the injury heals. Decreased blood flow shown on a Doppler ultrasound could also result from temporary vascular spasm, which can occur without any underlying vascular disease.
Query 3.2: The accuracy of arterial Doppler ultrasounds in detecting blood clots or peripheral artery disease.
Document 3.2: An arterial Doppler ultrasound is an effective tool for evaluating blood flow in the arteries and can detect abnormalities such as stenosis, blockages, or aneurysms. It can accurately assess whether there is a clot or any vascular disease in the arteries. In the absence of findings like stenosis or plaque, a decreased blood flow could be due to a temporary issue such as a vessel spasm rather than a chronic condition like peripheral artery disease. The Doppler is not used to diagnose blood clots in veins, as that is typically assessed with a D-dimer test or venous ultrasound.
Query 3.3: Differences between D-dimer tests and arterial Doppler ultrasounds in diagnosing blood clots.
Document 3.3: A D-dimer test is used to detect blood clots in the veins (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), as it measures the presence of fibrin degradation products in the blood. It is not useful for diagnosing arterial clots or diseases. In contrast, an arterial Doppler ultrasound evaluates blood flow in the arteries and can detect arterial clots, stenosis, or other abnormalities. If a D-dimer test is negative and an arterial Doppler does not show significant findings, the likelihood of a blood clot in either the veins or arteries is very low.
Query 3.4: Is peripheral artery disease common in young, non-smoking individuals?
Document 3.4: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is more commonly seen in older adults, smokers, and individuals with diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol. It is rare in young, non-smoking individuals with no significant risk factors. PAD typically manifests as pain in the legs during walking or exercise (claudication), and is associated with atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up in the arteries. In the case of a 33-year-old woman with no major risk factors, the likelihood of PAD is very low, especially in the absence of any significant findings on arterial Doppler or other imaging studies.
Query 3.5: Is it safe to fly with a history of leg pain, negative Doppler ultrasound, and negative D-dimer test?
Document 3.5: Flying is generally safe for individuals with leg pain, especially if tests like the Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer are negative for blood clots or vascular disease. However, long flights can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in certain individuals, so it is advisable to take precautions such as staying hydrated, moving around periodically, and wearing compression stockings if needed. In the absence of any significant findings from the Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer test, the risk of complications is minimal, and flying should be safe.
Query 3.6: Could changes in footwear or repeated ankle strain cause persistent leg and ankle pain?
Document 3.6: Repeated strain on the ankle, such as from improper footwear or physical activities, can lead to recurring sprains or chronic ankle instability, resulting in persistent pain and discomfort. In cases of recurrent ankle injuries or pain, an orthopedic evaluation can help identify underlying issues such as ligament damage, tendonitis, or improper joint mechanics. Treating the root cause, such as changing footwear or addressing biomechanical issues, can help resolve the pain and prevent further injury.
