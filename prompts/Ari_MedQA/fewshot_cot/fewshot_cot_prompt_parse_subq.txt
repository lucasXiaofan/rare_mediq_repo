A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints? A: Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, B: Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery, C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit, D: Bacterial infection of the orbital contents, E: Sympathetic hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the key signs and symptoms that suggest a diagnosis?
Subanswer: The patient shows signs of hyperthyroidism: unintended weight loss, amenorrhea, hot flashes, increased sweating, tachycardia (pulse 110/min), enlarged thyroid gland, moist palms, tremor, and hyperreflexia (deep tendon reflexes are 3+). She also has ocular symptoms: diplopia, ocular pain, proptosis (prominence of the globes), lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and inability to converge the eyes.
Subquestion: What condition is characterized by these ocular findings in the context of hyperthyroidism?
Subanswer: Graves disease is characterized by hyperthyroidism along with ocular manifestations known as Graves ophthalmopathy.
Subquestion: What is the pathophysiology of the ocular symptoms in Graves ophthalmopathy?
Subanswer: In Graves ophthalmopathy, autoimmune stimulation leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the orbital tissues. This causes swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat, leading to the ocular symptoms.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?
Subanswer: The most likely cause is glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit. The answer is C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit.

A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won’t move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition? A: Antibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic ion channels, B: Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, C: Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves, D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, E: Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn

### Response:
Subquestion: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Subanswer: The infant has rapidly progressing weakness starting from the upper body and moving downward, bilateral ptosis, sluggish pupillary response, weak sucking and gag reflexes, shallow respirations, drooling, constipation (dry diaper and no bowel movement), and decreased muscle strength.
Subquestion: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features?
Subanswer: These symptoms are characteristic of infant botulism.
Subquestion: What is the pathophysiology of infant botulism?
Subanswer: Botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the presynaptic terminals of the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNARE proteins necessary for neurotransmitter vesicle fusion.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's condition?
Subanswer: The pathophysiology is blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The answer is D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction.

### Instruction:
A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles? A: Anticipation, B: Incomplete penetrance, C: Multiple gene mutations, D: Pleiotropy, E: Variable expressivity

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Subanswer: The patient is a 9-month-old girl with developmental delays, lethargy, microcephaly, hypopigmentation compared to her family, a musty body odor, and has experienced a seizure.
Subquestion: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features?
Subanswer: These features are characteristic of phenylketonuria (PKU).
Subquestion: What is phenylketonuria and how does it affect the body?
Subanswer: PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to accumulation of phenylalanine and its toxic metabolites. This affects multiple organ systems, including neurological development, skin pigmentation, and causes the distinctive musty odor.
Subquestion: Which genetic principle explains multiple symptoms caused by a single gene mutation?
Subanswer: Pleiotropy, where a single gene mutation leads to multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Subanswer: The answer is D: Pleiotropy.

### Instruction:
A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Subanswer: The patient has bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), dizziness, bilateral facial muscle weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple soft, yellow skin plaques and papules.
Subquestion: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features?
Subanswer: These findings are consistent with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas.
Subquestion: What are schwannomas and from which cells are they derived?
Subanswer: Schwannomas are tumors of Schwann cells, which myelinate peripheral nerves. Schwann cells are derived from neural crest cells.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures?
Subanswer: The answer is C: Neural crest.

### Instruction:
A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? A: Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance, B: Local accumulation of kinins, C: Mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary parenchyma, D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, E: Incremental loss of functional residual capacity

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Subanswer: The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a 2-year history of chronic productive cough producing white phlegm, dyspnea on exertion (shortness of breath when climbing stairs), a 40-pack-year smoking history, and physical exam findings of wheezing and rhonchi.
Subquestion: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features?
Subanswer: These features are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis.
Subquestion: What is the pathophysiology of chronic bronchitis?
Subanswer: Chronic bronchitis involves hyperplasia and hypertrophy of mucus-secreting glands in the bronchi due to long-term exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke. This leads to excessive mucus production, airway inflammation, and obstruction of airflow during expiration.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Subanswer: The most likely underlying cause is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow. The answer is D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow.
