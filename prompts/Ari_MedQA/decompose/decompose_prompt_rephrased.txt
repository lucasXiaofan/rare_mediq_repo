Question 1: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? A: Ampicillin, B: Ceftriaxone, C: Ciprofloxacin, D: Doxycycline, E: Nitrofurantoin
Question 1.1: What clinical features in this pregnant patient suggest a possible diagnosis?
Answer 1.1: The patient is a 23-year-old pregnant woman with burning upon urination, a sign of dysuria. She has no fever, normal vitals, and no costovertebral tenderness. This presentation suggests acute uncomplicated cystitis, a type of UTI. The answer is cystitis.
Question 1.2: What are the preferred antibiotics for treating cystitis in pregnancy?
Answer 1.2: During pregnancy, antibiotics like nitrofurantoin are preferred due to their safety profile for both the mother and fetus. Other antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are contraindicated in pregnancy. The answer is Nitrofurantoin.
Question 1.3: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Answer 1.3: The best treatment for this pregnant patient with cystitis is Nitrofurantoin, which is safe in pregnancy. The answer is E: Nitrofurantoin.

Question 2: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud, B: Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize, C: Error in neural crest cell migration, D: Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus, E: Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
Question 2.1: What are the significant clinical findings in this infant's presentation?
Answer 2.1: The infant presents with 4 days of regurgitation, yellow vomit (bilious vomiting), and minimal abdominal distension. These findings suggest an obstruction in the GI tract. The answer is GI obstruction.
Question 2.2: What does the bilious vomiting suggest about the site of the obstruction?
Answer 2.2: Bilious vomiting indicates an obstruction distal to the stomach, likely in the duodenum or jejunum. The answer is a duodenal obstruction.
Question 2.3: Which embryologic abnormality is responsible for duodenal obstruction in this case?
Answer 2.3: The most likely cause of duodenal obstruction is an annular pancreas, caused by abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud. The answer is Abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud.
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Answer 2.4: The embryologic error is Abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud, causing an annular pancreas. The answer is A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud.

Question 3: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms? A: Factor V Leiden, B: Hemophilia A, C: Lupus anticoagulant, D: Protein C deficiency, E: Von Willebrand disease
Question 3.1: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Answer 3.1: The patient is a 20-year-old woman experiencing menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) for several years and lifelong easy bruising. Her mother has similar symptoms of easy bruising, suggesting a possible inherited condition.
Question 3.2: What do the laboratory findings indicate about her coagulation status?
Answer 3.2: The laboratory tests show a normal platelet count of 200,000/mm³, a normal prothrombin time (PT) of 12 seconds, and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 43 seconds. This suggests a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway while platelet function and the extrinsic pathway are normal.
Question 3.3: Which coagulation disorders present with these clinical features and lab findings, particularly in women?
Answer 3.3: Von Willebrand disease is a common inherited bleeding disorder that affects both men and women. It presents with mucosal bleeding symptoms like menorrhagia and easy bruising. It is associated with a normal platelet count, normal PT, and prolonged PTT due to decreased levels or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which carries and protects factor VIII in the intrinsic pathway.
Question 3.4: Why are the other options less likely to be the cause of her symptoms?
Answer 3.4: A) Factor V Leiden: This is a hypercoagulable disorder leading to increased risk of thrombosis, not bleeding. B) Hemophilia A: An X-linked recessive disorder affecting males, characterized by factor VIII deficiency, leading to prolonged PTT but typically presents in males. C) Lupus anticoagulant: Associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which paradoxically leads to thrombosis despite lab findings suggesting prolonged PTT. D) Protein C deficiency: Causes a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thrombosis, not bleeding.
Question 3.5: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Answer 3.5: The most likely cause is Von Willebrand disease. It explains her prolonged PTT, normal PT and platelet count, mucosal bleeding symptoms like menorrhagia and easy bruising, and the family history of similar symptoms in her mother. Therefore, the answer is E: Von Willebrand disease.

Question 4: A 35-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of seasonal allergies. He has been using intranasal vasoconstrictors several times per day for several weeks. What is a likely sequela of the chronic use of topical nasal decongestants? A: Epistaxis, B: Hypertension, C: Permanent loss of smell, D: Persistent nasal crusting, E: Persistent congestion
Question 4.1: What are intranasal vasoconstrictors and how do they work?
Answer 4.1: Intranasal vasoconstrictors are topical decongestants that work by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa. They are usually alpha-adrenergic agonists that reduce nasal swelling and congestion by decreasing blood flow to the nasal passages.
Question 4.2: What are the effects of chronic use of intranasal vasoconstrictors?
Answer 4.2: Chronic use of intranasal vasoconstrictors can lead to a condition called rhinitis medicamentosa, also known as rebound nasal congestion. This occurs when the nasal tissues become dependent on the medication, resulting in persistent or worsening congestion when the effect of the drug wears off.
Question 4.3: Now we can answer the question: What is a likely sequela of the chronic use of topical nasal decongestants?
Answer 4.3: The likely sequela is persistent congestion due to the rebound effect from prolonged use of nasal decongestants. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Persistent congestion.
