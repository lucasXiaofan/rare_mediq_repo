Question 1: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? A: Ampicillin, B: Ceftriaxone, C: Ciprofloxacin, D: Doxycycline, E: Nitrofurantoin
Question 1.1: What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
Answer 1.1: The patient is a 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presenting with burning upon urination, known as dysuria. She has no fever, normal vital signs, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. This suggests that she is experiencing an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically cystitis.
Question 1.2: Which antibiotics are safe and effective for treating cystitis during pregnancy?
Answer 1.2: During pregnancy, certain antibiotics are preferred due to their safety profiles for both the mother and the fetus. Nitrofurantoin is commonly used and considered safe during the second trimester for treating cystitis. Ampicillin may be less effective due to resistance. Ceftriaxone is typically reserved for more severe infections like pyelonephritis and is administered intravenously. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are contraindicated in pregnancy because they can harm fetal development.
Question 1.3: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Answer 1.3: The best treatment for this pregnant patient with acute cystitis is Nitrofurantoin, as it is safe during the second trimester and effective against common urinary pathogens. Therefore, the answer is E: Nitrofurantoin.

Question 2: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud, B: Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize, C: Error in neural crest cell migration, D: Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus, E: Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
Question 2.1: What are the key clinical features presented by the infant?
Answer 2.1: The infant is 3 weeks old with 4 days of fussiness and regurgitation of all feeds. The vomit is yellow in color (bilious vomiting). Physical examination shows minimal abdominal distension but no other abnormalities.
Question 2.2: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these clinical features?
Answer 2.2: Bilious vomiting in a neonate indicates an obstruction distal to the stomach but proximal to the ligament of Treitz. Minimal abdominal distension suggests a partial obstruction in the duodenum. A likely diagnosis is an annular pancreas causing duodenal obstruction.
Question 2.3: Which embryologic error leads to an annular pancreas?
Answer 2.3: An annular pancreas results from the abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud, which encircles the duodenum and can cause obstruction.
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Answer 2.4: The embryologic error is the abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud. Therefore, the answer is A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud.

Question 3: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms? A: Factor V Leiden, B: Hemophilia A, C: Lupus anticoagulant, D: Protein C deficiency, E: Von Willebrand disease
Question 3.1: What are the key clinical features presented by the patient?
Answer 3.1: The patient is a 20-year-old woman experiencing menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) for several years and lifelong easy bruising. Her mother has similar symptoms of easy bruising, suggesting a possible inherited condition.
Question 3.2: What do the laboratory findings indicate about her coagulation status?
Answer 3.2: The laboratory tests show a normal platelet count of 200,000/mm³, a normal prothrombin time (PT) of 12 seconds, and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 43 seconds. This suggests a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway while platelet function and the extrinsic pathway are normal.
Question 3.3: Which coagulation disorders present with these clinical features and lab findings, particularly in women?
Answer 3.3: Von Willebrand disease is a common inherited bleeding disorder that affects both men and women. It presents with mucosal bleeding symptoms like menorrhagia and easy bruising. It is associated with a normal platelet count, normal PT, and prolonged PTT due to decreased levels or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which carries and protects factor VIII in the intrinsic pathway.
Question 3.4: Why are the other options less likely to be the cause of her symptoms?
Answer 3.4: A) Factor V Leiden: This is a hypercoagulable disorder leading to increased risk of thrombosis, not bleeding. B) Hemophilia A: An X-linked recessive disorder affecting males, characterized by factor VIII deficiency, leading to prolonged PTT but typically presents in males. C) Lupus anticoagulant: Associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which paradoxically leads to thrombosis despite lab findings suggesting prolonged PTT. D) Protein C deficiency: Causes a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thrombosis, not bleeding.
Question 3.5: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Answer 3.5: The most likely cause is Von Willebrand disease. It explains her prolonged PTT, normal PT and platelet count, mucosal bleeding symptoms like menorrhagia and easy bruising, and the family history of similar symptoms in her mother. Therefore, the answer is E: Von Willebrand disease.

Question 4: A 35-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of seasonal allergies. He has been using intranasal vasoconstrictors several times per day for several weeks. What is a likely sequela of the chronic use of topical nasal decongestants? A: Epistaxis, B: Hypertension, C: Permanent loss of smell, D: Persistent nasal crusting, E: Persistent congestion
Question 4.1: What are intranasal vasoconstrictors and how do they work?
Answer 4.1: Intranasal vasoconstrictors are topical decongestants that work by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa. They are usually alpha-adrenergic agonists that reduce nasal swelling and congestion by decreasing blood flow to the nasal passages.
Question 4.2: What are the effects of chronic use of intranasal vasoconstrictors?
Answer 4.2: Chronic use of intranasal vasoconstrictors can lead to a condition called rhinitis medicamentosa, also known as rebound nasal congestion. This occurs when the nasal tissues become dependent on the medication, resulting in persistent or worsening congestion when the effect of the drug wears off.
Question 4.3: Now we can answer the question: What is a likely sequela of the chronic use of topical nasal decongestants?
Answer 4.3: The likely sequela is persistent congestion due to the rebound effect from prolonged use of nasal decongestants. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Persistent congestion.
