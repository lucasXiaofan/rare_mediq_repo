### Instruction:
A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? A: Ampicillin, B: Ceftriaxone, C: Ciprofloxacin, D: Doxycycline, E: Nitrofurantoin

### Response:
This pregnant patient presents with new-onset dysuria, most likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is a common complication of pregnancy, due to anatomic and physiologic changes. The initial management of UTI in pregnancy includes urine culture and antibiotic treatment based on local resistance patterns and the safety profile for use during pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin and oral cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) are considered first-line treatments for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnant women because they have good efficacy against common uropathogens and are low-risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. This patient should be started on nitrofurantoin assuming no contraindication, such as a hypersensitivity reaction or significant renal impairment. Other options such as ampicillin can be used for treatment; however, resistance is more common. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is typically avoided in pregnancy as it is associated with cartilage toxicity in animal studies and potential risk to fetal musculoskeletal development. Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is contraindicated in pregnancy after the first trimester because of risk of permanent tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth in the fetus. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Nitrofurantoin

### Instruction:
A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm
### Response:
This patient's clinical features are suggestive of neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple central nervous system tumors. The most common tumors associated with NF2 are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are presented in this case as masses at the internal auditory meatus and cerebellopontine angle. Schwannomas are benign tumors derived from Schwann cells, which originate from the neural crest cells. Neural crest cells give rise to a variety of cell types and tissues, including the peripheral nerves and associated Schwann cells, amongst other structures. The soft, yellow plaques and papules on his skin might be cutaneous neurofibromas, another hallmark of neurofibromatoses. Sensorineural hearing loss, facial weakness, unsteady gait, and the appearance of tumors in the brain are classic findings in NF2. MRI is used to visualize the masses associated with the condition. The other options (Neural tube, Surface ectoderm, Notochord, Mesoderm) are incorrect in the context of NF2 and the origin of Schwann cells. - Neural tube gives rise to the central nervous system. - Surface ectoderm gives rise to structures such as the epidermis, hair, nails, and the lens of the eye. - Notochord gives rise to the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs in adults. - The mesoderm gives rise to muscle, bone, connective tissue, and the urogenital and vascular systems. Correct Answer is C: Neural crest
### Instruction:
A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles? A: Anticipation, B: Incomplete penetrance, C: Multiple gene mutations, D: Pleiotropy, E: Variable expressivity

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The infant presents with developmental delay, lethargy, microcephaly, hypopigmentation, a musty body odor, and has experienced a seizure. These features are characteristic of phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its toxic metabolites, affecting multiple systems. The varied symptoms—neurological deficits, pigmentation changes, and odor—are due to a single gene defect affecting multiple organ systems. This is an example of pleiotropy, where one gene mutation leads to multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects. The answer is D: Pleiotropy.

A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient has bilateral acoustic neuromas (masses near internal auditory meatus and cerebellopontine angle), leading to hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and facial muscle weakness. He also has multiple soft, yellow skin lesions, which could be schwannomas or neurofibromas. These findings are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Schwann cells give rise to schwannomas, and these cells are derived from neural crest cells during embryological development. Therefore, the abnormal cells are derived from the neural crest. The answer is C: Neural crest.

### Instruction:
A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? A: Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance, B: Local accumulation of kinins, C: Mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary parenchyma, D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, E: Incremental loss of functional residual capacity

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient is a long-term smoker with a chronic productive cough of white phlegm for 2 years and dyspnea on exertion. Physical exam shows wheezing and rhonchi. These findings are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke, leading to hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands and obstruction of airways. The primary issue is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow due to mucus plugging and airway inflammation. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow. The answer is D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow.
