Original Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints? A: Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, B: Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery, C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit, D: Bacterial infection of the orbital contents, E: Sympathetic hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris
Rephrased Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of double vision and eye pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of missed periods, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is pleased to have lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland enlarged to twice its normal size. Eye examination shows bulging eyes (proptosis), bilateral lid retraction, red conjunctiva, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain with movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Neurological examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's eye symptoms? A: Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, B: Abnormal connection between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery, C: Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the orbit, D: Bacterial infection of the orbital contents, E: Overactivity of the sympathetic nerves to the levator palpebrae superioris

Original Question: A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won’t move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition? A: Antibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic ion channels, B: Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, C: Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves, D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, E: Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn
Rephrased Question: A 1-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to weakness and a change in behavior noticed since this morning, worsening over time. His parents observed initial weakness in his upper body and arms, which has progressed to decreased strength in his legs. Physical examination reveals bilateral drooping eyelids (ptosis) with sluggish pupil response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow breathing. The child is drooling and has a dry diaper, with no bowel movement in over a day. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition? A: Antibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic ion channels, B: Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, C: Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves, D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, E: Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn

Original Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles? A: Anticipation, B: Incomplete penetrance, C: Multiple gene mutations, D: Pleiotropy, E: Variable expressivity
Rephrased Question: A 9-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home without complications according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed she is not reaching developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings and often appears lethargic. Physical examination reveals a small head size (microcephaly), very light skin pigmentation compared to her family, and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease are most likely due to which of the following genetic principles? A: Anticipation, B: Incomplete penetrance, C: Multiple gene mutations, D: Pleiotropy, E: Variable expressivity

Original Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm
Rephrased Question: A 23-year-old man visits the physician due to decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination reveals multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. He has sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral facial muscle weakness. His gait is unsteady. MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory canal and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological origins? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm

Original Question: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? A: Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance, B: Local accumulation of kinins, C: Mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary parenchyma, D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, E: Incremental loss of functional residual capacity
