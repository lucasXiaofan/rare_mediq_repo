### Instruction:
A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of double vision and eye pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of missed periods, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is pleased to have lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland enlarged to twice its normal size. Eye examination shows bulging eyes (proptosis), bilateral lid retraction, red conjunctiva, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain with movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Neurological examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's eye symptoms? A: Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, B: Abnormal connection between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery, C: Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the orbit, D: Bacterial infection of the orbital contents, E: Overactivity of the sympathetic nerves to the levator palpebrae superioris

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient is exhibiting signs of hyperthyroidism: weight loss despite a history of being overweight, amenorrhea, hot flashes, increased sweating, tachycardia, enlarged thyroid gland, moist palms, tremor, and hyperreflexia. Additionally, she has ocular symptoms like diplopia, ocular pain, proptosis (prominence of the globes), lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and inability to converge the eyes. These ocular findings are characteristic of Graves ophthalmopathy, which is caused by autoimmune stimulation leading to the deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the orbital tissues. This accumulation results in swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat. Therefore, the most likely cause of her ocular complaints is glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit. The answer is C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit.

A 1-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to weakness and a change in behavior noticed since this morning, worsening over time. His parents observed initial weakness in his upper body and arms, which has progressed to decreased strength in his legs. Physical examination reveals bilateral drooping eyelids (ptosis) with sluggish pupil response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow breathing. The child is drooling and has a dry diaper, with no bowel movement in over a day. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition? A: Antibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic ion channels, B: Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, C: Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves, D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, E: Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The infant has rapidly progressing weakness starting from the upper body and moving downward, bilateral ptosis, sluggish pupils, weak sucking and gag reflexes, shallow respirations, drooling, constipation (dry diaper and no bowel movement), and decreased muscle strength. These symptoms are consistent with infant botulism, caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores (often from honey) that produce botulinum toxin. The toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the presynaptic terminals of the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNARE proteins necessary for vesicle fusion. This blockade leads to flaccid paralysis and autonomic dysfunction. Therefore, the pathophysiology is blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The answer is D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction.

A 9-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home without complications according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed she is not reaching developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings and often appears lethargic. Physical examination reveals a small head size (microcephaly), very light skin pigmentation compared to her family, and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease are most likely due to which of the following genetic principles? A: Anticipation, B: Incomplete penetrance, C: Multiple gene mutations, D: Pleiotropy, E: Variable expressivity

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The infant presents with developmental delay, lethargy, microcephaly, hypopigmentation, a musty body odor, and has experienced a seizure. These features are characteristic of phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its toxic metabolites, affecting multiple systems. The varied symptoms—neurological deficits, pigmentation changes, and odor—are due to a single gene defect affecting multiple organ systems. This is an example of pleiotropy, where one gene mutation leads to multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects. The answer is D: Pleiotropy.

### Instruction:
A 23-year-old man visits the physician due to decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination reveals multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. He has sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral facial muscle weakness. His gait is unsteady. MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory canal and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological origins? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient has bilateral acoustic neuromas (masses near internal auditory meatus and cerebellopontine angle), leading to hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and facial muscle weakness. He also has multiple soft, yellow skin lesions, which could be schwannomas or neurofibromas. These findings are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Schwann cells give rise to schwannomas, and these cells are derived from neural crest cells during embryological development. Therefore, the abnormal cells are derived from the neural crest. The answer is C: Neural crest.

### Instruction:
A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician due to a 2-year history of coughing and fatigue. She has a morning cough productive of white phlegm and becomes short of breath when climbing stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia and recently retired from nursing at a homeless shelter. She has a 40-pack-year smoking history. Her medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Vital signs are temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations 24/min, pulse 85/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals scattered wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields. Heart sounds are distant with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? A: Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance, B: Local accumulation of kinins, C: Mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary parenchyma, D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, E: Incremental loss of functional residual capacity

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient is a long-term smoker with a chronic productive cough of white phlegm for 2 years and dyspnea on exertion. Physical exam shows wheezing and rhonchi. These findings are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke, leading to hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands and obstruction of airways. The primary issue is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow due to mucus plugging and airway inflammation. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow. The answer is D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow.
