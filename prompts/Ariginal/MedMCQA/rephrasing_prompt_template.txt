Original Question: A 56-year-old man has been having bloody bowel movements on and off for the past several weeks. He reports that the blood is bright red, it coats the outside of the stools, and he can see it in the toilet bowl even before he wipes himself. When he does so, there is also blood on the toilet paper. After further questioning, it is ascertained that he has been constipated for the past 2 months and that the caliber of the stools has changed. They are now pencil thin, rather than the usual diameter of an inch or so that was customary for him. He has no pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids
Rephrased Question: A 56-year-old man presents with the following symptoms: Intermittent bright red blood in his bowel movements over the past several weeks. Blood that coats the outside of the stools and is visible in the toilet bowl before wiping. Blood present on toilet paper after wiping. Constipation for the past 2 months. A change in stool caliber to pencil-thin stools, narrower than his usual. Absence of pain during bowel movements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids

Original Question: A 67-year-old man with an 18-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents for a routine physical examination. His temperature is 36.9 °C (98.5 °F), his blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg, and his pulse is 82/min and regular. On examination, the physician notes a non-tender, pulsatile mass in the mid-abdomen. A plain abdominal X-ray film with the patient in the lateral position reveals spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aortic wall. Following surgery, the patient is placed on a low-fat diet to reduce the risk of continued progression of his atherosclerotic disease. A bile acid sequestrant is added to interrupt enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Which of the following agents was MOST likely prescribed? A: Atorvastatin, B: Cholestyramine, C: Clofibrate, D: Gemfibrozil
Rephrased Question: A 67-year-old man with an 18-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus comes in for a routine physical examination. His vital signs are: Temperature: 36.9 °C (98.5 °F). Blood pressure: 158/98 mm Hg. Pulse: 82/min, regular. During the examination, the physician notes: A non-tender, pulsatile mass located in the mid-abdomen. An abdominal X-ray taken in the lateral position shows: Spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aortic wall. After undergoing surgery, the patient is advised to follow a low-fat diet to reduce the progression of his atherosclerotic disease. A bile acid sequestrant is prescribed to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Which of the following agents was most likely prescribed? A: Atorvastatin, B: Cholestyramine, C: Clofibrate, D: Gemfibrozil

Original Question: An 86-year-old man has become progressively unable to live independently for the past 10 years, and he now requires assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, and transfers in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination, he has no motor or sensory deficits. He cannot give the current date or state where he is. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. At autopsy, there is a large superficial left parietal lobe hemorrhage. Histologic examination of the brain shows numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats
Rephrased Question: An 86-year-old man has experienced a progressive decline in his ability to live independently over the past 10 years. He now requires assistance with: Bathing, Dressing, Toileting, Feeding, Transferring in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination: He has no motor or sensory deficits. He is unable to provide the current date or identify his location. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy findings include: A large superficial hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. Histologic examination reveals numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats

Original Question: A 30-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus presents to her physician at 19 weeks\' gestation. She is obese and did not realize that she was pregnant until recently. She also has not been "watching her sugar" lately, but is now motivated to improve her regimen. A dilated ophthalmologic examination shows no retinopathy. An ECG is normal. Urinalysis is negative for proteinuria. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin A 1c: 10.8% , Glucose: 222 mg/dL , Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 1.0 μU/mL, Free thyroxine: 1.7 ng/dL ,Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL. \nIn which of the following condition the risk of developing it is same in diabetics as the general population. A: Asymptomatic bacteriuria, B: Preeclampsia, C: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, D: PPH after delivery
Rephrased Question: A 30-year-old obese woman with a history of diabetes mellitus presents to her physician at 19 weeks' gestation. Key details include: She did not realize she was pregnant until recently. She has not been managing her blood sugar levels ("not watching her sugar") but is now motivated to improve her regimen. Clinical evaluations reveal: Dilated ophthalmologic examination: No retinopathy, Electrocardiogram (ECG): Normal, Urinalysis: Negative for proteinuria. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin A1c: 10.8%, Blood glucose: 222 mg/dL, Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 1.0 μU/mL, Free thyroxine (T₄): 1.7 ng/dL, Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL.
