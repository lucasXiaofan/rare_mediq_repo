A 60-year-old man who is a chronic smoker presents with painless, gross hematuria that began one day ago. Which of the following is the investigation of choice to determine the cause of his hematuria? A: Ultrasound (USG), B: X-ray of the Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder (KUB), C: Urine routine examination, D: Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells

### Response:
Let's think step by step. A 60-year-old chronic smoker presenting with painless gross hematuria is highly suggestive of bladder cancer, as smoking is a major risk factor accounting for about 50% of cases. Among the given options, urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells is the best investigation because it can detect exfoliated cancer cells from the urothelium, providing a non-invasive and specific method for identifying malignancy. While ultrasound and X-ray KUB can detect structural abnormalities, they are less sensitive for detecting bladder tumors. Urine routine examination confirms hematuria but does not identify malignant cells. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation is urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells. The answer is D: Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells.

A 56-year-old man presents with the following symptoms: Intermittent bright red blood in his bowel movements over the past several weeks. Blood that coats the outside of the stools and is visible in the toilet bowl before wiping. Blood present on toilet paper after wiping. Constipation for the past 2 months. A change in stool caliber to pencil-thin stools, narrower than his usual. Absence of pain during bowel movements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A: Anal fissure, B: Cancer of the cecum, C: Cancer of the rectum, D: External hemorrhoids

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The 56-year-old man is experiencing intermittent bright red blood coating the outside of his stools, visible in the toilet bowl before wiping, along with blood on the toilet paper. He also reports constipation and a change in stool caliber to pencil-thin stools over the past two months, without any pain. Bright red blood coating the stool suggests bleeding from a distal part of the colon or rectum. The change to pencil-thin stools indicates a narrowing of the rectal lumen, likely due to an obstructing mass such as rectal cancer. Anal fissures typically cause severe pain during defecation and produce streaks of blood, but pain is absent in this case. Cancer of the cecum usually presents with occult blood loss leading to anemia, not visible bright red bleeding or changes in stool caliber. External hemorrhoids can cause discomfort and itching, and while they may bleed, they do not cause changes in stool caliber. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cancer of the rectum. The answer is C: Cancer of the rectum.

A 67-year-old man with an 18-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus comes in for a routine physical examination. His vital signs are: Temperature: 36.9 °C (98.5 °F). Blood pressure: 158/98 mm Hg. Pulse: 82/min, regular. During the examination, the physician notes: A non-tender, pulsatile mass located in the mid-abdomen. An abdominal X-ray taken in the lateral position shows: Spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aortic wall. After undergoing surgery, the patient is advised to follow a low-fat diet to reduce the progression of his atherosclerotic disease. A bile acid sequestrant is prescribed to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Which of the following agents was most likely prescribed? A: Atorvastatin, B: Cholestyramine, C: Clofibrate, D: Gemfibrozil

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The 67-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes is found to have a non-tender, pulsatile mass in the mid-abdomen; imaging shows spotty calcification of a dilated abdominal aortic wall, indicating an abdominal aortic aneurysm due to atherosclerosis. After surgery, he's placed on a low-fat diet and prescribed a bile acid sequestrant to interrupt enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Among the options, cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant that binds bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption, leading to increased conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in the liver and thereby lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, while clofibrate and gemfibrozil are fibric acid derivatives that mainly reduce triglycerides by activating lipoprotein lipase. Therefore, the most likely prescribed agent is cholestyramine. The answer is B: Cholestyramine.

An 86-year-old man has experienced a progressive decline in his ability to live independently over the past 10 years. He now requires assistance with: Bathing, Dressing, Toileting, Feeding, Transferring in and out of chairs and bed. On physical examination: He has no motor or sensory deficits. He is unable to provide the current date or identify his location. Six months later, he suddenly becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy findings include: A large superficial hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. Histologic examination reveals numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease? A: Aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, B: Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP), C: Dopamine deficiency, D: Expansion of polyglutamine repeats

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The 86-year-old man has experienced a progressive decline in cognitive function over 10 years, requiring assistance with daily activities, which is indicative of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The autopsy findings reveal numerous neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with Congo red staining of the cerebral arteries and plaque cores, indicating amyloid deposition. The mechanism behind Alzheimer's disease involves the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This leads to amyloid plaque formation and can cause cerebral amyloid angiopathy, contributing to hemorrhagic strokes like the one observed in the left parietal lobe. Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for his disease is aggregation of Aβ peptide. The answer is A: Aggregation of Aβ peptide.

### Instruction:
An elderly housewife, who lost her husband to a sudden myocardial infarction a few years ago, had been living alone for almost a decade with only occasional visits from her son and grandchildren. About a week after his death, she began to clearly hear his voice speaking to her from the next room, as he typically would in daily life. Upon checking, she found no one there. Since then, she frequently hears his voice and engages in conversations with him about her daily life. These experiences, however, have led to increasing anxiety and a persistently sad mood, particularly when she becomes fixated on thoughts of him. What would be the appropriate treatment for her? A: Clomipramine, B: Alprazolam, C: Electroconvulsive therapy, D: Haloperidol

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The elderly woman lost her husband suddenly due to a myocardial infarction a couple of years ago. They had been living alone with infrequent visits from family. About a week after his death, she began hearing his voice talking to her as he would routinely, but when she checked, no one was there. She continues to hear his voice and even converses with him about daily matters. This provokes anxiety and sadness when she is preoccupied with his thoughts. These symptoms indicate she is experiencing auditory hallucinations of her deceased husband, which is a sign of morbid (complicated) grief. Morbid grief occurs when the normal grieving process is exaggerated or prolonged beyond six months, and may include psychotic features like hallucinations. Treatment for morbid grief depends on the presenting symptoms. Since she is primarily experiencing distressing auditory hallucinations, an antipsychotic medication is appropriate. Among the options, haloperidol is an antipsychotic that can help alleviate her symptoms. The answer is D: Haloperidol.
