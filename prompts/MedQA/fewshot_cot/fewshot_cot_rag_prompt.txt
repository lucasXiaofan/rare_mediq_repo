### Instruction:
A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won't move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition? A: Antibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic ion channels, B: Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, C: Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves, D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, E: Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn

### Relevant Documents:
Infant Botulism: Caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores (common sources include honey and soil). Spores germinate in the infant's gut, producing botulinum toxin.
Botulinum Toxin Mechanism: Blocks the release of acetylcholine at presynaptic neuromuscular junctions by cleaving SNARE proteins. Results in flaccid paralysis and autonomic dysfunction.
Clinical Features: Symmetric descending paralysis starting with cranial nerves (ptosis, poor suck, weak gag reflex).
Autonomic symptoms: constipation, dry mouth, drooling. Hypotonia and respiratory difficulties.
### Response:
Let's think step by step. The infant presents with rapidly progressing weakness starting in the upper body and moving downward, bilateral ptosis with sluggish pupillary response, weak sucking and gag reflexes, shallow respirations, drooling, and constipation (dry diaper, no bowel movement). These symptoms are characteristic of infant botulism, caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores that produce botulinum toxin. The toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the presynaptic terminals of the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNARE proteins necessary for neurotransmitter release. This blockade leads to flaccid paralysis and autonomic dysfunction. Therefore, the pathophysiology is blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The answer is D: Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction.

### Instruction:
A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3 cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2 cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? A: Neural tube, B: Surface ectoderm, C: Neural crest, D: Notochord, E: Mesoderm

### Relevant Documents:
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2): An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Caused by mutations in the NF2 gene encoding merlin.
Schwann Cells: Cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. Derived from neural crest cells.
Neural Crest Derivatives: Include Schwann cells, melanocytes, adrenal medulla cells, and cranial nerve ganglia.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient presents with decreased hearing, dizziness, tinnitus, bilateral facial muscle weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple soft, yellow skin lesions. MRI reveals masses near the internal auditory meatus and cerebellopontine angle, consistent with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Schwann cells, which give rise to schwannomas, are derived from neural crest cells during embryological development. Therefore, the abnormal cells in these masses are derived from the neural crest. The answer is C: Neural crest.

### Instruction:
A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5 °C (97.7 °F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? A: Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance, B: Local accumulation of kinins, C: Mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary parenchyma, D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, E: Incremental loss of functional residual capacity

### Relevant Documents:
Chronic Bronchitis (a form of COPD): Defined by a productive cough lasting at least 3 months in two consecutive years. Caused by prolonged exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke.
Pathophysiology: Hyperplasia and hypertrophy of mucus-secreting glands in the bronchi. Excess mucus production leads to airway obstruction, especially during expiration.
Clinical Features: Chronic productive cough with sputum. Dyspnea on exertion. Wheezing and rhonchi on auscultation. Smoking and COPD: Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Causes chronic inflammation and structural changes in the airways.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The patient is a long-term smoker with a chronic productive cough of white phlegm for 2 years and experiences shortness of breath when walking up stairs. Physical examination reveals scattered wheezing and rhonchi. These findings are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke, leading to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands, resulting in excessive mucus production and airway obstruction. The primary issue is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow due to mucus plugging and airway narrowing. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow. The answer is D: Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow.
