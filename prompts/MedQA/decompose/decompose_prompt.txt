Question 1: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? A: Ampicillin, B: Ceftriaxone, C: Ciprofloxacin, D: Doxycycline, E: Nitrofurantoin
Question 1.1: What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
Answer 1.1: The patient is a 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presenting with burning upon urination, known as dysuria. She has no fever, normal vital signs, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. This suggests that she is experiencing an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically cystitis.
Question 1.2: Which antibiotics are safe and effective for treating cystitis during pregnancy?
Answer 1.2: During pregnancy, certain antibiotics are preferred due to their safety profiles for both the mother and the fetus. Nitrofurantoin is commonly used and considered safe during the second trimester for treating cystitis. Ampicillin may be less effective due to resistance. Ceftriaxone is typically reserved for more severe infections like pyelonephritis and is administered intravenously. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are contraindicated in pregnancy because they can harm fetal development.
Question 1.3: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Answer 1.3: The best treatment for this pregnant patient with acute cystitis is Nitrofurantoin, as it is safe during the second trimester and effective against common urinary pathogens. Therefore, the answer is E: Nitrofurantoin.

Question 2: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud, B: Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize, C: Error in neural crest cell migration, D: Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus, E: Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
Question 2.1: What are the key clinical features presented by the infant?
Answer 2.1: The infant is 3 weeks old with 4 days of fussiness and regurgitation of all feeds. The vomit is yellow in color (bilious vomiting). Physical examination shows minimal abdominal distension but no other abnormalities.
Question 2.2: What is the most likely diagnosis based on these clinical features?
Answer 2.2: Bilious vomiting in a neonate indicates an obstruction distal to the stomach but proximal to the ligament of Treitz. Minimal abdominal distension suggests a partial obstruction in the duodenum. A likely diagnosis is an annular pancreas causing duodenal obstruction.
Question 2.3: Which embryologic error leads to an annular pancreas?
Answer 2.3: An annular pancreas results from the abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud, which encircles the duodenum and can cause obstruction.
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Answer 2.4: The embryologic error is the abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud. Therefore, the answer is A: Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud.

Question 3: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints? A: Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, B: Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery, C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit, D: Bacterial infection of the orbital contents, E: Sympathetic hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris
Question 3.1: What are the key signs and symptoms that suggest a diagnosis?
Answer 3.1: The patient shows signs of hyperthyroidism: unintended weight loss, amenorrhea, hot flashes, increased sweating, tachycardia (pulse 110/min), enlarged thyroid gland, moist palms, tremor, and hyperreflexia (deep tendon reflexes are 3+). She also has ocular symptoms: diplopia, ocular pain, proptosis (prominence of the globes), lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and inability to converge the eyes.
Question 3.2: What condition is characterized by these ocular findings in the context of hyperthyroidism?
Answer 3.2: Graves disease is characterized by hyperthyroidism along with ocular manifestations known as Graves ophthalmopathy.
Question 3.3: What is the pathophysiology of the ocular symptoms in Graves ophthalmopathy?
Answer 3.3: In Graves ophthalmopathy, autoimmune stimulation leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the orbital tissues. This causes swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat, leading to the ocular symptoms.
Question 3.4: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?
Answer 3.4: The most likely cause is glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit. The answer is C: Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit.
