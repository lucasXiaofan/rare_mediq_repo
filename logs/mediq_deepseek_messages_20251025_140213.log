On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and irregular, complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. On examination, the physician finds diffuse skin pallor and orders a complete blood count. Her laboratory data demonstrate a hematocrit of 27.1%, MCV of 79 fL, and a reticulocyte count of 2.0%.
