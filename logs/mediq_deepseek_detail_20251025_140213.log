A patient comes into the clinic presenting with a symptom as described in the conversation log below:
    
PATIENT INFORMATION: A 21-year-old sexually active male complains of fever, pain during urination, and inflammation and pain in the right knee.
CONVERSATION LOG:
None
QUESTION: The mechanism of action of the medication given blocks cell wall synthesis, which of the following was given?
OPTIONS: A: Gentamicin, B: Ciprofloxacin, C: Ceftriaxone, D: Trimethoprim
YOUR TASK: Medical conditions are complex, so you should seek to understand their situations across many features. First, consider which medical specialty is this patient's case; then, consider a list of necessary features a doctor would need to make the right medical judgment; finally, consider whether all necessary information is given in the conversation above. How confident are you to pick the correct option to the problem factually using the conversation log? Choose between the following ratings:
"Very Confident" - The correct option is supported by all evidence, and there is enough evidence to eliminate the rest of the answers, so the option can be confirmed conclusively.
"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct option is more likely than other options, more information is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct option, but further evidence is needed to be sure which one is the correct option.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one options, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the options.
"Very Unconfident" - There are not enough evidence supporting any of the options, the likelihood of picking the correct option at this point is near random guessing.

Think carefully step by step, respond with the chosen confidence rating ONLY and NOTHING ELSE.

A patient comes into the clinic presenting with a symptom as described in the conversation log below:
    
PATIENT INFORMATION: A 41-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of fatigue and weakness.
CONVERSATION LOG:
Doctor Question: Have you noticed any changes in your menstrual bleeding, such as heavier or longer periods?
Patient Response: The patient cannot answer this question, please do not ask this question again.
QUESTION: Which of the following represents the most likely etiology of her anemia.
OPTIONS: A: Vitamin B12 deficiency, B: Folate deficiency, C: Iron deficiency, D: Intravascular hemolysis
YOUR TASK: Medical conditions are complex, so you should seek to understand their situations across many features. First, consider which medical specialty is this patient's case; then, consider a list of necessary features a doctor would need to make the right medical judgment; finally, consider whether all necessary information is given in the conversation above. How confident are you to pick the correct option to the problem factually using the conversation log? Choose between the following ratings:
"Very Confident" - The correct option is supported by all evidence, and there is enough evidence to eliminate the rest of the answers, so the option can be confirmed conclusively.
"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct option is more likely than other options, more information is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct option, but further evidence is needed to be sure which one is the correct option.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one options, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the options.
"Very Unconfident" - There are not enough evidence supporting any of the options, the likelihood of picking the correct option at this point is near random guessing.

Think carefully step by step, respond with the chosen confidence rating ONLY and NOTHING ELSE.

OPTIONS: A: Exertional heat stroke, B: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, C: Non-exertional heat stroke, D: Septic shock
YOUR TASK: Medical conditions are complex, so you should seek to understand their situations across many features.

"Very Confident" - The correct option is supported by all evidence, and there is enough evidence to eliminate the rest of the answers, so the option can be confirmed conclusively.
"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct option is more likely than other options, more information is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct option, but further evidence is needed to be sure which one is the correct option.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one options, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the options.
"Very Unconfident" - There are not enough evidence supporting any of the options, the likelihood of picking the correct option at this point is near random guessing.

A patient comes into the clinic presenting with a symptom as described in the conversation log below:
    
PATIENT INFORMATION: A 32-year-old man presents to a mission hospital in Cambodia because he has had difficulty walking from his village to the market.
CONVERSATION LOG:
Doctor Question: How long have you been experiencing difficulty walking?
Patient Response: The patient has been experiencing difficulty walking over the last year.
QUESTION: The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following enzymatic reactions?
OPTIONS: A: Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, B: Acyl transferases, C: Glycogen phosphorylase, D: Homocysteine methyltransferase
YOUR TASK: Medical conditions are complex, so you should seek to understand their situations across many features. First, consider which medical specialty is this patient's case; then, consider a list of necessary features a doctor would need to make the right medical judgment; finally, consider whether all necessary information is given in the conversation above. How confident are you to pick the correct option to the problem factually using the conversation log? Choose between the following ratings:
"Very Confident" - The correct option is supported by all evidence, and there is enough evidence to eliminate the rest of the answers, so the option can be confirmed conclusively.
"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct option is more likely than other options, more information is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct option, but further evidence is needed to be sure which one is the correct option.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one options, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the options.
"Very Unconfident" - There are not enough evidence supporting any of the options, the likelihood of picking the correct option at this point is near random guessing.

Think carefully step by step, respond with the chosen confidence rating ONLY and NOTHING ELSE.
