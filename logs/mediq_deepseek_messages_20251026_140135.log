She complains that over the past week there have been 3 episodes where he has fallen asleep while speaking with her. She mentioned that these events began a few months ago and have been increasing in frequency. She also says that his snoring has gotten to the point where she has a hard time sleeping next to him. When asked, the patient says that he frequently falls asleep while reading or watching television in the afternoons and feels refreshed after a short nap. The patient is worried because he sometimes hears people who aren’t in the room as he falls asleep. He is worried he might be “going crazy.” He has noticed that when his friends tell him a joke or he laughs at something on the TV, he drops whatever he’s holding and feels like his legs become weak. These episodes self-resolve in a few seconds. Examination shows a morbidly obese man in no acute distress."\nQuestion from the doctor: "What specific symptoms or concerns prompted your wife to bring you to the clinic today?"\nUse the context paragraph to answer the doctor\'s question.
